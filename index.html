  <p>Dear visitors,</p>
  
  <p>I am writing to inform you that I am closing my website, MarketingScales.com. I have decided to do this because I no longer have the time to maintain the website.</p>

  <p>I would like to thank you for your support over the years. I have enjoyed providing you with access to my scales library, the world's largest database of consumer insight measures. 
    I hope that you will continue to follow my research on [social media platforms]. You can also email me at [email address] to keep in touch. However, I may not be able to respond to emails as quickly as I used to.</p>
  
  <p>Thank you again for your support.</p>

  <p>Sincerely,<br/>
  Dr. Gordon C. Bruner II
